# Budget-Aware LLM Reasoning Demo

This is an interactive demo showcasing budget-guided LLM reasoning, inspired by the paper "Steering LLM Thinking with Budget Guidance" ([arXiv:2506.13752](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13752)).

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run locally: `python app.py`

## Development
- The app uses Gradio for the web interface
- Case studies are stored in `case_studies.py`
- To deactivate the virtual environment: `deactivate`

More details will be added as development progresses.
